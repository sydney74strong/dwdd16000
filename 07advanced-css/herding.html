            <h1 id=”herding”>Herding</h1>
            <p>Dog herding is an old sport that is still used today in the farming industry, and is often preferred to newer methods of moving livestock. It started out of necessity to move the large herds of grazing animals such as cows, sheep, and goats to different pastures. Today, many of these beloved Herding breeds are kept as pets rather than as a strictly working animal, creating the need for herding sports to fufill these dogs intense desire to work.</p>
            <p>There are many different styles of herding, and the style is mostly determined by breed, however there are exceptions. Whether it simply be a dog with a quirky personality or because of training, a herding dog is very versatile, and isn’t restrained to herding the same animals in the same style.</p>

           <h4>Sheepdog trials</h4>
            <p>This is one of the most practical sports, as it is near identical to how these dogs are used in the working world. At it’s most basic, it is the use of dogs to herd groups of animals. There are near countless variations between the different tests and trials, each with their own complex scoring systems.<br> If you would like to learn more about the complex world of dog herding competitions, the <a href="https://www.akc.org/sports/herding/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">AKC</a> has a wonderful guide for beginners, as well as ways to find <a href="https://webapps.akc.org/event-search/#/search" target="_blank" rel="noopener">competitions</a> near you.</p>
            <h5>Treibball</h5>
            <p>Trieball is an interesting sport that arose from a dogs desire to herd that didn’t have easy access to any stock. So, instead of using stock, a large ball was used as a replacement. Instead of balancing the complex dynamics that come with moving a large groups of animals, a dog must instead apply those same concepts to a ball, and learn how to move it with exclusively physical force. The funnest part about trieball, you don’t need to sign up for a competition or find a stock to herd, instead, you just need to obtain a herding ball. While there are still plenty of competitions to sign up for when <a href="https://nationaltreibball.com/Register-Your-Dog" target="_blank" rel="noopener">registered</a>, this is one of the few sports that is easy to do in one’s backyard.</p>
