            <p>As society has advanced the need for working dogs has lessened, and many dogs have found themselves with their only job to be providing companionship. This can create problems however, as many of these these dogs still feel the need to work and play. This is because there is hundreds, if not thousands of years of breeding behind the need to help their human companions. Like a huskys endless energy and strong desire to pull a sled, or a retrievers desire to, well, retrieve. When they don't have a job to fufill this desire, it can lead to destructive behaviors, and frustration for both the human and dog. Thus creates the need for doggy sports. A way for the modern human to bond with their canine companions by letting them do whatever they were bred to do.</p>
            <p>But that's not the only reason for dog sports, some were created just as a way for dogs to have fun, and many sports have smaller competitions and leagues just for dogs that weren't bred for a sport, but enjoy it anyway. At the end of the day, no matter the sport and no matter the dog, these events have evolved to get any pup's energy out in a fun way that also help strengthen the bond between human and dog.</p>  
            <p>There are many dog sports, for all types of dogs and people. These sports are often sorted into different categories based on the type of task. Below, is a list of the categories of dog sports.</p>
