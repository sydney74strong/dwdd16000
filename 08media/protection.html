        <h1>Protection</h1>
        <p>Using a dog for protection is not a new idea, however this modern day and age has made the need for one rare. However, that does not change the fact that many of our canine companions were bred for such a purpose, to watch out for those they care about. Many dogs enjoy this, and often get stressed if they feel as though they arenâ€™t fulfilling their purpose. So, the need for protection sports arose, from the everyday housepet to those wanting to train their dog as an actual protection dog, methods and equipment has been made to safely hone these dogs instincts. There are a few different types of protection sports, however most are just forms of highly advanced training, mainly focusing on cornering someone, biting a limb, and not letting go. There are tools to keep both the human and dog safe, and you will find an example of that in the video below. </p>
